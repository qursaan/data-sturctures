# Queue Project

## Task 1

- In the QueueArray template class, you are required to implement/update the following functionalities:

1. Create a circular array-based queue structure with the necessary attributes (read, write, array, size, etc.).
2. Constructor and Destructor
    - Create Constructor and Destructor to initialize and release resources for the circular array-based queue.
3. Enqueue & Dequeue Function
    - Implement a function enqueue that adds a new element to the rear of the queue. Make sure to handle the circular nature of the array and resizing when necessary.
    - Implement a function dequeue that removes the element from the front of the queue. Ensure that the queue is updated correctly after the removal.
4. Front Function
    - Implement a function front that returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
5. IsEmpty & IsFull Function
    - Implement a function find that takes an element as a parameter and returns the index of the first occurrence of that element in the list. If the element is not found, return -1.
    - Implement a function isFull that returns true if the queue is full and false otherwise.
6. Size Function
    - Implement a function size that returns the number of elements currently in the queue.
7. Testing and Demonstration
    - Create an instance of QueueArray for a specific data type (int) and demonstrate its usage of the new functionalities, including enqueuing and dequeuing elements, checking the front element, checking if the queue is empty or full, and displaying the size of the queue.
