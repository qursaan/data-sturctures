# DynamicArray Project

## Task 1: Create a DynamicArray template class

- Create a C++ template class called DynamicArray to represent a dynamic array of elements.

1. Main Template Class:
    - Create a C++ template class called DynamicArray to represent a dynamic array of elements.
    - Allow the user to specify the type of elements the array will hold.
2. Constructor and Destructor:
    - How can you design the constructor to initialize the dynamic array with a given size?
    - How can you ensure that the destructor properly cleans up the dynamic memory allocated by the class?
3. Copy Constructor:
    - Implement a copy constructor that allows creating a copy of an existing DynamicArray object.
4. Resize Function:
    - How can you create a function resize that allows changing the size of the dynamic array while preserving existing elements?
    - What steps are needed to allocate new memory and copy data when resizing?
5. Get Size Function:
    - Implement a function getSize that returns the current size of the array.
6. Testing and Demonstration:
    - Create a main function to test the DynamicArray template class.
    - Create an instance of DynamicArray for a specific data type (int) and demonstrate its usage.
